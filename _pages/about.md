# ✌️ About me
I am now a Ph.D. candidate of [Westlake University--SMART joint PhD programme](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/admissions_aid/graduate/zsdt1/202403/t20240304_37512.shtml) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) and [SMART](https://smart.org.cn/). You can find my CV here:[Zhenjiang's Curriculum Vitae](assets/Zou Zhenjiang-CV.pdf). My previous research mainly focus on the application of bioinformatics in animal breeding. I have the background of processing sequencing data, analysis of transcriptome and GWAS, data visualization and wet experiment. My research interest now lays broadly in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. My strength lies in my excellent command of English and my amiable personality, which empowers me to collaborate effectively with team members and achieve high productivity. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an email.

[Identification of SNPs and candidate genes associate with growth performance in all-female mandarin fish (*Siniperca chuatsi*) by a genome-wide association study](assets/1-s2.0-S0044848624002394-main.pdf), ***AQUACULTURE***

**Dingrui Liu**, Jin Zhang, Zhenjiang Zou, et al

- 
The first GWAS analysis on growth traits of all-female Mandarin fish (Dinggui I, *Siniperca Chuatsi*) was conducted. A total of 6 significant and 25 suggestive SNPs were detected on multiple chromosomes. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained for these SNPs ranged from 9.66% to 19.47% for growth traits.

[Effects of salinity on growth, physiology, biochemistry and gut microbiota of juvenile grass carp (*Ctenopharyngodon idella*)](assets/1-s2.0-S0166445X23000851-main.pdf), ***AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY***

**Dingrui Liu**, Zhuowei Zhang, Yikun Song, et al

- 
Grass carp exhibited great adaptability to low salinity (2 ppt), with no significant difference in growth and maintained stable physiological and immune status. However, exposed to high salinity (6 ppt) caused deleterious effects on grass carp, including growth inhibition as well as physiological and immune-related changes. The gut microbiota in grass carp changed with salinity.

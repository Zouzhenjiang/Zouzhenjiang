# ✌️ About me
I am now a master student at the [School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University](https://lifesciences.sysu.edu.cn/). Here is my CV:[Zhenjiang's Curriculum Vitage](assets/Zou Zhenjiang-CV.pdf). My research currently centers on elucidating the anti-disease immune mechanisms of aquatic animals by leveraging single-cell transcriptomics and integrated multi-omics analysis. With a solid foundation in managing sequencing data, conducting single-cell transcriptome analyses, visualizing data, and performing molecular biology experiments, my current research passions lie within the realms of bioinformatics and computational biology. I possess excellent English proficiency and a pleasant demeanor, enabling me to collaborate seamlessly with team members to accomplish our objectives.  If you are intrigued by my research endeavors, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at any time.

[Interaction mechanism of lipid metabolism remodeling, oxidative stress, and immune response mediated by *Epinephelus coioides* SRECII [(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584924010918)],

- 
SRECII from *Epinephelus coioides* (EcSRECII) modulate fatty acid oxidation and oxidative stress levels via interactions with lipoprotein particles. EcSRECII mediates the internalization of oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein (oxLDL), thereby inducing lipid accumulation.

[Identification of SNPs and candidate genes associate with growth performance in all-female mandarin fish (*Siniperca chuatsi*) by a genome-wide association study](assets/1-s2.0-S0044848624002394-main.pdf),

Dingrui Liu, Jin Zhang, **Zhenjiang Zou**, et al

- 
The first GWAS analysis on growth traits of all-female Mandarin fish (Dinggui I, *Siniperca Chuatsi*) was conducted. A total of 6 significant and 25 suggestive SNPs were detected on multiple chromosomes. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained for these SNPs ranged from 9.66% to 19.47% for growth traits.

Double antibody sandwich ELISA(DAS-ELISA) based on *i-fabp* gene of Carassius auratus I-FABP was developed by using the recombinant protein I-FABP to produce rabbit and mouse polyclonal antibodies. The linear regression equation of the standard curve is y=0.003 5x+0.036 7,R^2^ is 0.9991, and the critical value is 0.0906. Intra-lot and inter-lot variation coefficients were 1.17%-5.50% and 0.16%-4.78%, respectively. The method was used to detect 54 samples, and the coincidence rate was 100% compared with commercial kits.

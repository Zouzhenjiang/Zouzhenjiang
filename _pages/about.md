# ✌️ About me
I am now a master student at the [School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University](https://lifesciences.sysu.edu.cn/). Here is my CV:[Zhenjiang's Curriculum Vitage](assets/Zou Zhenjiang-CV.pdf). My research currently centers on elucidating the anti-disease immune mechanisms of aquatic animals by leveraging single-cell transcriptomics and integrated multi-omics analysis. With a solid foundation in managing sequencing data, conducting single-cell transcriptome analyses, visualizing data, and performing molecular biology experiments, my current research passions lie within the realms of bioinformatics and computational biology. I possess excellent English proficiency and a pleasant demeanor, enabling me to collaborate seamlessly with team members to accomplish our objectives.  If you are intrigued by my research endeavors, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at any time.

[Identification of SNPs and candidate genes associate with growth performance in all-female mandarin fish (*Siniperca chuatsi*) by a genome-wide association study](assets/1-s2.0-S0044848624002394-main.pdf), ***AQUACULTURE***

Dingrui Liu, Jin Zhang, **Zhenjiang Zou**, et al

- 
The first GWAS analysis on growth traits of all-female Mandarin fish (Dinggui I, *Siniperca Chuatsi*) was conducted. A total of 6 significant and 25 suggestive SNPs were detected on multiple chromosomes. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained for these SNPs ranged from 9.66% to 19.47% for growth traits.

[Effects of salinity on growth, physiology, biochemistry and gut microbiota of juvenile grass carp (*Ctenopharyngodon idella*)](assets/1-s2.0-S0166445X23000851-main.pdf), ***AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY***

**Dingrui Liu**, Zhuowei Zhang, Yikun Song, et al

- 
Grass carp exhibited great adaptability to low salinity (2 ppt), with no significant difference in growth and maintained stable physiological and immune status. However, exposed to high salinity (6 ppt) caused deleterious effects on grass carp, including growth inhibition as well as physiological and immune-related changes. The gut microbiota in grass carp changed with salinity.
